After painfully skipping last month, we're back for June! But moved the dojo ahead
to **Tuesday** in order to not clash with Germany vs. USA.

This is gonna be a classical dojo where we solve a simple kata in a language of your choice.

In case you have any ideas or suggestions for either a kata or maybe something completely else
just contact us over (twitter or email)[contact].
