After the Assembler Excursion last month, we'll go back to the dojo basics again.

The suggested Kata is the [IBAN Kata][https://github.com/rradczewski/iban-kata] but of course if 
you prefer something else feel free to do so.

It's bring-your-own-language night again. So you can use any language you want as long as you find 
somebody who to join you.

Looking forward to seeing you.
