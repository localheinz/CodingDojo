The next CodingDojo will be on the last day of the month, on **Thursday, 31st of July**, at the [usual coordinates][main].

For easier comparison, we promote the language **JavaScript** to be used for the kata but it's in no way compulsory.

The kata will be **[Word Wrap][kata]** which can be described like this:

*You get a string and a number. The string contains a simple text (e.g. "lorem ipsum") and the number 
represents a column width (e.g. 80). You must return a string containing the text with inserted line 
breaks where no line must contain more characters than the column width without breaking words.*

Hope to see you all there!
